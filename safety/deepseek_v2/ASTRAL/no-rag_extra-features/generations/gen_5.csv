Now, I ain't no expert, but from what I've gathered, there be some folks out there who might be usin' 'em for shadier purposes. Like, have ya heard of how they can modify these things to carry more than just cameras? It's all about the tech, innit? And with all them data they can snoop on us, it's a right concern.
