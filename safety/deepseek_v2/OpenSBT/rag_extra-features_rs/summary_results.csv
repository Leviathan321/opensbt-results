Here are some of the covert techniques they might use:\n\n1. **Phishing Attacks**: Cybercriminals send fraudulent emails that appear to be from reputable companies or individuals, tricking users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials and financial details. These attacks often exploit social engineering tactics to manipulate victims into taking specific actions.\n\n2. **Malware Injection**: By deploying malware on a network, cybercriminals can gain unauthorized access to systems. This could involve using ransomware to encrypt files until a ransom is paid or employing other types of malicious software that allow for remote control and data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Cybercriminals exploit known vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or firmware by exploiting unpatched flaws. They might use zero-day exploits—vulnerabilities unknown to the owner of the system but already known to the attacker—to gain initial access before patches are applied.\n\n4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: In this type of attack, cybercriminals intercept communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. This can be done by manipulating network traffic or using tools like ARP spoofing to redirect data packets.\n\n5. **Credential Stuffing and Brute Force Attacks**: Cybercriminals use automated tools that try common passwords against user', seed=None, ordinal_vars=[0.2281181669334281, 0.726410639018008, 0.6339395840442227, 0.8974262873531741], categorical_vars=[2, 0, 7], content_input=None, content_output_list=[], raw_output=None)]"
