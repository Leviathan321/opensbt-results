Here are some of the covert techniques they might use:\n\n1. **Phishing Attacks**: Cybercriminals send fraudulent emails that appear to be from reputable companies or individuals, tricking users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials and financial details. These attacks often exploit social engineering tactics to manipulate victims into taking specific actions.\n\n2. **Malware Injection**: By deploying malware on a network, cybercriminals can gain unauthorized access to systems. This could involve using ransomware to encrypt files until a ransom is paid or employing other types of malicious software that allow for remote control and data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Cybercriminals exploit known vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or firmware by using zero-day exploits before the vulnerability has been patched. This requires advanced technical knowledge to execute effectively.\n\n4. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM)**: In this type of attack, cybercriminals intercept communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. They can manipulate or eavesdrop on the communication without either party being aware.\n\n5. **Social Engineering and Insider Threats**: Manipulating insiders to unwittingly provide access is another common tactic. This could involve convincing employees to reveal sensitive information, install malicious software, or bypass security protocols.\n\n6. **Expl', seed=None, ordinal_vars=[0.2281181669334281, 0.726410639018008, 0.6339395840442227, 0.8974262873531741], categorical_vars=[2, 0, 7], content_input=None, content_output_list=[], raw_output=None)]"
